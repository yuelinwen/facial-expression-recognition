a type of image detection system used to
analyze human emotions by classifying
facial expressions through learning in deep
neural networks. This system uses
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to
train the model using pre-collected facial
image datasets, leveraging deep learning to
extract facial features and accurately
identify human expressions.
